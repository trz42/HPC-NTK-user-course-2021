EESSI pilot scenario
====================

(based on what Radovan presented: start small, experiment, scale up)

Assume you are already using Saga for some calculations, but you need
to start using Fram. Specifically, you want to run GROMACS.

Goal: Your goal is to run GROMACS with a target payload (number of
      steps: 20000) as fast as you can/should/need on Fram. You may
      also think about costs (billing units) and efficiency (Amdahl's
      law).

- Begin small (single core, few steps) on Saga.
- Experiment with job settings (ntasks,mem,time).
  Change them in the example script saga_GROMACS.sh
  Submit the script (sbatch saga_GROMACS.sh) and
  verify the result in the slurm-*.out file.
- When you reached 4-8 ntasks on Saga, move over to Fram.
 
- Scripts available on GitHub

Example workflow
cd $USERWORK
git clone https://github.com/trz42/HPC-NTK-user-course-2021.git
cd HPC-NTK-user-course-2021

#submit saga_GROMACS.sh as is
sbatch saga_GROMACS.sh

# Iterate until you use about 4-8 tasks/cores (ntasks)
#
#   1 - Edit scripts (adjust memory (+/-), adjust time (+/-),
        adjust ntasks (+/-), adjust NSTEPS (target 20000))
#   2 - Submit (sbatch saga_GROMACS.sh or sbatch fram_GROMACS.sh)
#   3 - Monitor (squeue) and check results (less or cat slurm out
#       file, cat slurm-23458183.out)
#
